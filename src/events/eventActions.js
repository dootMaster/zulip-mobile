/**
 * Connect to the Zulip event system for real-time updates.
 *
 * For background on the Zulip event system and how we use it, see docs from
 * the client-side perspective:
 *   https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/main/docs/architecture/realtime.md
 * and a mainly server-side perspective:
 *   https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html
 *
 * First does POST /register, which is sometimes called the "initial fetch".
 * because the response comes with a large payload of current-state data
 * that we fetch as part of initializing the event queue:
 *   https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html#the-initial-data-fetch
 *
 * Then immediately starts an async loop to poll for events.
 *
 * We fetch private messages here so that we can show something useful in
 * the PM conversations screen, but we hope to stop doing this soon (see
 * note at `fetchPrivateMessages`). We fetch messages in a few other places:
 * to initially populate a message list (`ChatScreen`), to grab more
 * messages on scrolling to the top or bottom of the message list
 * (`fetchOlder` and `fetchNewer`), and to grab search results
 * (`SearchMessagesScreen`).
